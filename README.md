# Autonomous Code Summarization with Large Language Models

## Objective

The primary objective is to develop an autonomous AI tool leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for the automatic generation of concise summaries for each function within a given application's codebase. The ultimate goal is to significantly improve code comprehension without necessitating additional input from the user.

## Research Overview

### Current State of Code Summarization

#### 1. **Instruction Prompting**
- **Approach:** Utilizes natural language prompts for LLMs to generate code summaries.
- **Pros:** Enables zero-shot or few-shot learning.
- **Cons:** Relies heavily on prompt quality and specificity.

#### 2. **Task-oriented Fine-tuning**
- **Approach:** LLMs are fine-tuned on datasets of code snippets and summaries.
- **Pros:** Improves performance and consistency.
- **Cons:** Requires substantial training data and computational resources.

#### 3. **Prompt Learning**
- **Approach:** Combines instruction prompting and fine-tuning using a prompt agent.
- **Pros:** Offers increased flexibility and potential resource efficiency.
- **Cons:** Increased complexity and reduced interpretability.

### Key Findings and Challenges

1. **Code LLMs vs. Generic LLMs:**
   - **Finding:** LLMs pre-trained on large code corpora outperform generic LLMs.
   - **Implication:** Emphasizes the importance of domain-specific pre-training for optimal performance.

2. **Zero-shot Methods:**
   - **Finding:** Zero-shot methods excel when training and test sets have different distributions.
   - **Implication:** Highlights LLMs' generalization ability and the need for caution in few-shot methods.

3. **Challenges in Code Summarization:**
   - **Finding:** LLMs may struggle with complex or lengthy code.
   - **Implication:** Human evaluation remains vital for quality assurance.

## Advanced Approaches

### 1. Hybrid Prompting
- **Proposed Approach:** Start with human-written instruction prompts and refine them using continuous prompts from a prompt agent.
- **Rationale:** Balances performance and resource efficiency, leveraging human expertise.

### 2. Code Structure-Aware Fine-tuning
- **Proposed Approach:** Incorporate code structure using a code parser for abstract syntax trees (ASTs) and a graph neural network (GNN) for encoding.
- **Rationale:** Enhances the LLM's ability to capture hierarchical and syntactic information, resulting in more coherent summaries.

### 3. Multi-Task Learning
- **Proposed Approach:** Leverage the synergy between code generation, code explanation, and code summarization in a multi-task LLM.
- **Rationale:** Facilitates knowledge transfer and diversified summary generation.

## Choice of LLMs

### Criteria for Selection

#### 1. Architecture
- Choose an architecture (e.g., Transformer, GPT, BERT) capable of handling large vocabularies, long code sequences, and natural language summaries.

#### 2. Pre-training Technique
- Select a pre-training technique (e.g., MLM, CLM, contrastive learning) effectively leveraging large and diverse code corpora.

#### 3. Adaptability to Autonomy
- Prioritize LLMs (e.g., CodeBERT, GraphCodeBERT, Codex) demonstrating adaptability to autonomously generate summaries for any code snippet.

## Implementation Strategy

### 1. Data Collection and Preparation
- **Strategy:** Collect diverse datasets, including existing code summarization datasets and the application's codebase.
- **Preprocessing:** Thoroughly preprocess data through tokenization, normalization, and alignment of code and natural language.

### 2. Model Selection and Training
- **Choice:** Select a suitable LLM (CodeBERT, GraphCodeBERT, Codex, or custom-built).
- **Fine-tuning:** Train the LLM on a dedicated code summarization dataset using appropriate loss functions (e.g., cross-entropy, ROUGE).
- **Evaluation:** Assess LLM performance on test sets using metrics like BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, or human evaluation.

### 3. Model Deployment and Testing
- **Interface Design:** Develop a user-friendly interface for the autonomous AI code summarization tool.
- **Deployment:** Deploy and rigorously test the LLM to ensure it autonomously generates high-quality summaries for diverse code snippets.

# Recent Research in Autonomous Code Summarization

## Application of Synthesize, Execute, Debug (SED) Approach

In the realm of program synthesis with Large Language Models (LLMs), the "near miss syndrome" has been effectively addressed through the Synthesize, Execute, Debug (SED) approach. This methodology involves the sequential process of generating a draft solution, followed by a dedicated program repair phase. Our exploration focuses on identifying optimal prompts and striking a balance between repair-focused, replace-focused, and hybrid debug strategies.

## GSCS: Generating Summaries for Java Methods

Introducing a novel approach known as the Graph-based Semantic Code Summarizer (GSCS) designed to elevate the field of source code summarization, specifically for Java methods. GSCS leverages both semantic and structural information by employing Graph Attention Networks on tokenized abstract syntax trees. Rigorous evaluation on Java datasets confirms that GSCS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, signifying advancements in code summarization techniques.

## LLMs in Problem Solving: Addressing Limitations

While Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 provide intuitive natural language interfaces for problem-solving, certain limitations arise, such as the inability to fetch recent data or domain-specific knowledge. Overcoming these constraints necessitates the incorporation of external data and tools alongside LLMs. This article offers insights into the architectural considerations behind autonomous agents, providing potential solutions to enhance their problem-solving capabilities.

## Source Code Summarization: Enhancing Tool Capabilities

Source Code Summarization has emerged as a pivotal technology for automatically generating concise descriptions of code. In a notable study, professional Java programmers participated in an eye-tracking experiment to identify key elements for effective code summarization. Leveraging these findings, a novel summarization tool was developed to enhance the selection process, thereby improving the overall quality of code summaries.

## Autofolding: Enhancing Code Comprehension

The introduction of the autofolding problem seeks to enhance code comprehension by automatically creating a code summary through the folding of less informative code regions. This innovative solution formulates the problem as a sequence of Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) folding decisions, leveraging a scoped topic model for code tokens. Evaluation on open-source projects demonstrated a significant 28% reduction in errors, establishing autofolding as a valuable tool for program comprehension.
